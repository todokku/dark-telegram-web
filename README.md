Last readme update: 11-09-2019

======== INSTALLATION ========

1. - install ANY custom css plugin for your browser.
     For google Chrome I recommend 
     https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-css/okpjlejfhacmgjkmknjhadmkdbcldfcb
     
2. - Open telegram web, click on the plugin icon (Top right corner for Chrome).
3. - You'll see a window pop out. Paste next line into it.

@import url("https://dl.dropbox.com/s/tuk1t8ntvn84375/dark.css?dl=0");

( ";" included! ). All updates are automatic.




This repository is some kind of easilly viewable code source.
The reason the link is heading to the Dropbox is that even "raw git" doesn't give me needed result.
For some reason, only Dropbox servers could "respond" to certain requests needed for fetching code from the css file.


At the momment of (11.09.2019) NONE of the websites listed below, will work as CSS sheet host:

pastebin.com /
google drive /
github /
mega.nz /
