2. - Open telegram web, click on plugin icon (Top right corner for Chrome).
3. - Youll see a window pop out. Paste next line into it (14th line to be exactly).

@import url("https://dl.dropbox.com/s/tuk1t8ntvn84375/dark.css?dl=0");

( ";" included! ). All updates are automatic.




This repository is some kind of easilly viewable source.
The reason link is heading to the dropbox is that even "raw git" doesn't give me needed result.
For some reason, only dropbox servers could "respond" to certain requests needed for fetching code from the css file.


At the momment of (11.09.2019) NONE of websites listed below, will NOT work as CSS host:

pastebin.com
google drive
github
mega.nz
